#My interactive resume
http://adica.me.cz/resume/

My responsive online resume was the final project of the Basics of JavaScript course. I wrote the JavaScript/jQuery code which turns the given data stored in JSON into HTML. I also adjust the CSS style and improve the responsivity. All the graphics and the images are optimized so the site is loading fast.
